Copy [`default.json`](https://github.com/rpj/yafssg/blob/main/config/default.json)
to a new file in the same directory; name it `local.json`.

Fill in the appropriate fields as necessary, being sure to give a value to `metadata.site_fqdn`, which is required.

The following fields in `template_vars` allow HTML: `header.main_title`, `header.site_fqdn`,
and `header.main_content`.

The layout of the site is kept in the `templates/` directory, the path of which is configurable via 
`templates_source_path`.

YAFSSG uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating. You can copy
the enterity of the `templates/` folder, modify it & change the value of `templates_source_path`
to point at it, in order to make use of your new templates.

This site's configuration can be examined
[here](https://github.com/rpj/yafssg/blob/main/doc-demo/config/demo.json).
