To build the site into the <code>output_path</code> configuration variable, simply run:

```
$ ./yafssg build
```

You will see output similar to the following detailing the actions taken and the paths the artifacts were written to:

```

```

As you can see, this output also serves as a helpful locator for finding Draft or Hidden post URL postfixes.

Put the contents of `output_path` in a hosted folder, _et voil√†_!
